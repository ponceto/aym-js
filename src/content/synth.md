AYM·Synth is a virtual [AY-3-8910 / YM2149]({{< ref "/about.md" >}}) synthesizer.

The virtual synthesizer is made up of two emulated chips thus offering an instrument with an incredible polyphony of six voices that you can control directly using the [MIDI protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI).

It is based on the AYM·JS emulator, the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) and the [Web MIDI API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_MIDI_API).

### The synthetizer

Simply connect your MIDI instrument, click `Power` and enjoy playing music with chiptune style!
